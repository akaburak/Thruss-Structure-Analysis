# Truss-Structure-Analysis
  Truss Structure analysis executes a stress and displacement analysis on a specific structure that is user defined.
First, a structure is built by using nodes and elements. Boundary conditions and the forces to be applied are determined afterwards.
After building the structure and entering the boundary conditions along with the forces, using Finite Elements Method (FEM), stress and displacement analysis is executed.
### Features
- Specific cross sectional area and Youngâ€™s Modulus values
- Various color bar options
- Magnitude bar to observe the changes easily
- Option to observe the Stiffness, stress and displacement tables
- Option to read a structure from an excel file
